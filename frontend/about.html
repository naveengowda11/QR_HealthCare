<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
<div class="card">
  <h2>QR Health Access System</h2>
  <p>
    QR Health Access System is a hospital-driven digital health platform designed
    to solve one of the most critical problems in emergency healthcare: the lack
    of verified patient medical information at the point of care. In real-world
    emergencies, patients are often unconscious or unable to communicate their
    medical history, leading doctors to make decisions with incomplete data.
  </p>
  <p>
    This system ensures that patient information is entered and verified only
    by hospitals, eliminating errors caused by self-reported data. Each patient
    is issued a unique QR code that provides limited but life-saving information
    during emergencies, while full medical records remain securely accessible
    only to authorized doctors.
  </p>
  <p>
    By combining role-based access control, secure data handling, and QR-based
    retrieval, the platform bridges the gap between emergency response and
    informed clinical decision-making. The solution is designed as a centralized
    national platform, scalable across hospitals, and adaptable for future
    integration with government health systems and AI-driven diagnostics.

      <h3>Naveen Kumar B</h3>
      <p>
        Naveen Kumar B was responsible for designing and implementing the complete backend
        architecture of the QR Health Access System. He developed the authentication
        flow for hospitals, session-based access control, and ensured that patient
        data ownership is strictly tied to the registering hospital. He also handled
        database schema design, patient record management, and secure file storage
        for medical reports such as CT scans and laboratory documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to backend development, Naveen implemented the QR code generation
        logic, ensuring that each QR uniquely maps to a verified patient record and
        correctly exposes only emergency-safe information. He focused on building a
        stable, scalable MVP architecture suitable for real-world deployment and
        Imagine Cup evaluation, while keeping security, privacy, and performance as
        top priorities throughout development.

      <h3>Yashwin Gowda K</h3>
      <p>
        Yashwin Gowda K was primarily responsible for frontend development and user interface
        design. They designed the multi-page layout of the system, including hospital
        login, registration, dashboard, emergency access, and doctor views. Special
        attention was given to creating a clean, professional, and hospital-grade UI
        that aligns with real electronic medical record systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        They structured complex patient registration forms into logical sections such
        as basic information, medical history, clinical data, and document uploads,
        ensuring usability for hospital staff. Their work focused on clarity, ease of
        navigation, and visual consistency to ensure the platform is intuitive for
        both demonstrations and potential real-world usage.

      <h3>Shalini M G</h3>
      <p>
         Shalini M G contributed extensively to research, problem analysis, and domain
        understanding of healthcare workflows. They studied real emergency scenarios
        to identify what information is truly critical during first response and
        helped define the distinction between emergency-access data and full medical
        records.
      </p>
      <p>
        They played a key role in shaping the system’s access control logic and
        emergency data presentation, ensuring that the solution prioritizes patient
        safety while maintaining privacy. Their insights helped align the project
        closely with real hospital practices and emergency response protocols.

      <h3>Priya K</h3>
      <p>
        Priya K focused on documentation, presentation strategy, and Imagine Cup
        alignment. They helped structure the project narrative, ensuring that the
        problem statement, solution, impact, and future scope are clearly articulated
        for judges and stakeholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        They also contributed to testing workflows, validating edge cases, and
        preparing demonstration scenarios that highlight the system’s strengths.
        Their work ensured that the project is not only technically sound but also
        communicated effectively as a scalable, socially impactful solution.
